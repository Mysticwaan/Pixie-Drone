## 1. Conceptualize Your Companion

Decide on the overall look (humanoid, futuristic, or animal-like) and features (like arms, lights, and voice interactions).

## 2. 3D Model the Body Parts

Use software like **Tinkercad** or **Fusion 360** to design small arms, legs, or aesthetic enhancements that can be attached to the drone.

## 3. Print the Attachments

Use a **3D printer** to fabricate the parts. Materials like **PLA** are lightweight and easy to work with, making them suitable for drone modifications.

## 4. Create a Mounting System

Design a simple mounting system for attaching the 3D-printed parts to the drone, ensuring balance for flight.

## 5. Attach LED Lights

Add small LED lights to the body and face for a friendly, interactive look. These can be powered by the drone’s onboard system or a separate small battery pack.

## 6. Program Autonomous Flight Features

Use the **DJI SDK** or apps like **Litchi** to program autonomous flight modes such as following, hovering, or circling.

## 7. Install a Voice-Control System

Integrate voice control using a **Raspberry Pi** and **Google Assistant** or an offline assistant. This would allow you to command the drone via voice.

## 8. Test and Adjust the Flight Balance

After adding the body parts, perform flight tests to ensure the drone can still fly properly. Adjust the weight and position of the parts to maintain balance.

## 9. Create Sound Feedback System

Attach a small **Bluetooth speaker** or custom audio setup to allow the drone to “talk” or provide
